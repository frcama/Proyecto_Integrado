                                <p>The new production by the company Taiat Dansa dives into play and avant-garde with the help of the children's audience. Boys and girls will enter the theater and embark on an adventure-like stage that will reveal the mysteries of the number 3 and its meanings.

                                <h3>In Other Words: Dialogues with Édouard Louis and Roy Galan</h3>
                                <p>It's been ten years since the publication of Édouard Louis' autobiographical book, Goodbye to Eddy Bellegueule, a story that recounts a childhood of homophobia, machismo, racism, alcoholism, and above all, poverty that transcends the walls of his home and makes the narrative universal and political. Following this success, Louis has continued to explore the wounds of his childhood and the reality of the working class with lucidity and empathy. Édouard Louis will discuss his work and the themes within it with writer Roy Galan, who has also clearly depicted how masculinities operate.</p>

                                <h3>Érase</h3>
                                <p>Érase is an unlikely tale of daughters to mothers, of ducks to grandmothers, of milkmaids to hunters. A tale that fell behind the wardrobe and never came out of the wolf's guts again. A story about us, about how no story ever invented has been able to explain how we should care, dance, work, laugh, or kiss.</p>

                                <h3>XIX PolinizaDos</h3>
                                <p>The 19th Edition of the PolinizaDos Urban Art Encounter returns to the Vera Campus of the Polytechnic University of Valencia from May 13 to 17, 2024. This year, the Encounter will focus on collective processes, relational dimension, and the revision of common discourses in urban art. With the prominent participation of Mexico as the guest country, through cooperation with the INBAL National School of Painting, Sculpture, and Engraving "La Esmeralda", the Encounter aims to explore the diverse perspectives and traditions of urban art, thus enriching cultural dialogue and fostering international collaboration. As part of the classic mural interventions in the Campus spaces, a highlighted feature of this year's proposals is the emphasis on collective production and community practices.</p>
